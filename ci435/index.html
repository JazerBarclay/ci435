                    <div class="article-main">
                        <!-- Main element of article -->
                        <p>For my first week of CI435, I was tasked with: reading our course specification on MyStudies and setting up my brighton.domains account where I will be making my first three HTML pages.<sup><a href="#w1-1">1</a></sup></p>

                        <h4>Setting up brighton domains</h4>
                        <p>The lab session started with logging into the computers and accessing the MyStudies page. Here I could go to CI435 to view all the information about the web development module.</p>
                        <p>In the module area there are the following sections:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Module Information which shows the module specification, the teaching plan and link to teaching staff contact details</li>
                            <li>Reading List -  A list of books we can access virtually to learn more about HTML and CSS</li>
                            <li>Assessments and Marks - A grading criteria and module guideline</li>
                            <li>Study Materials -  Where all the content from the lectures is accessible and other learning resources</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the study section, there’s a folder called '<em>SEMESTER 1 study material</em>' where the slides for the previous lectures are available.</p>
                        <p>Under week 1 there is a link to the lecture and another for the lab tutorial site <em>jh1033.bright.domains</em> with instructions for building the website.</p>
                        <p>Starting at the induction and going through setting up brighton.domains. I went to the dashboard tab at the top and logged into my account.</p>
                        <p>Here I can access the file manager to see the files hosted on the server.</p>
                        <p>We were instructed to create a new folder named ‘<em>ci435</em>’ under the public_html folder which is the root folder of the hosted website.</p>
                        <p>Since this is an apache server hosted on a linux system, the folders when we later access them on the live URL, are case sensitive so keeping to lower case makes navigation simple as long as we keep to that design pattern. Note also that the web page names must also follow this convention.</p>
                        <p>In this new folder we can create a new file named ‘<em>index.html</em>’. This is the default file the server will use when the folder is accessed. Here is where our learning journal site will begin.</p>

                        <h4>Starting the 3 pages</h4>
                        <p>There was a template provided in the lab tutorial which we were instructed to copy into the contents of the index.html document and save.</p>
                        <p>With the contents saved, if I navigated to the url <em>jb2139.brighton.domains/ci435</em>, I could see the copied template live from any device.</p>
                        <p>Next I created the second and third pages for the tutorial and contact pages respectively using the same template from the first (index) page.</p>
                        <p>These were based from the same template however must link back to all there other pages on the site.</p>
                        <p>Though these were based on the same template, they must link back to all the other pages on the site.</p>
                        <p>I used the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag to create links between the different pages and ensured they all worked on every page.</p>
                        <p>I found that the live version of the site sometimes didn’t update and as a result I found that Chrome has ‘<em>hard refresh</em>’ functionality where holding Shift and clicking the refresh button would force the page to be called rather than using a cached version which was no longer up to date.</p>
                        <p>With how the domain hosting is setup, I would create a new subdomain for each project so rather than a subdirectory called <em>ci435</em>, I would make a subdomain ci435.jb2139.brighton.domains. This separation would make for future package management easier should I use wordpress or another content management system.</p>

                        <h4>W3C validation</h4>
                        <p>As a final step to our first week lab session, we needed to test that our code conformed to the W3C standards for HTML5.</p>
                        <p>My website index.html, tutorial.html and contact.html all gave no errors and no warnings.</p>
                        <p>I checked the next week’s lab page and we will be covering HTML markup such as time, lists, anchors, images and email links.<sup><a href="#w1-2">2</a></sup></p>

                        <!-- BONUS SECTION -->
                        <h4>Further learning</h4>
                        <p>I notices when writing up this section that there references are in an aside element only in the wrapper rather than per section. I did some searching for if the HTML5 standard recommends only a single aside element however using one per article is accepted as good practice. The aside element is used to identify content that is related to the primary content of the webpage, but does not constitute the primary content of the page.<sup><a href="#w1-3">3</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Since testing the web pages, I have added my code to Github where all changes are stored and kept backed up. By hosting my code here, I can keep track of all the weekly changes and revert my code should I break something and want to go back to the last working version.<sup><a href="#w1-4">4</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Downloaded the code from GitHub to my personal laptop where I could make local changes without constantly updating the web page. I’ve found this useful when working off-line when commuting and also prefer the interface of Visual Studio Code which is the editor I use for programming.<sup><a href="#w1-5">5</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Furthermore I have started to use FileZilla to upload my code since the GitHub action cannot upload automatically due to how the SFTP server is configured.<sup><a href="#w1-6">6</a></sup></p>
                        
                        <p>In summary, this week I learned how to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Set up a folder for my website on my Brighton Domains workspace</li>
                            <li>Link two pages together with a navigation menu using a relative link</li>
                            <li>Create links to external websites using an absolute link</li>
                            <li>When to use the <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> tags</li>
                            <li>Update the web page title</li>
                            <li>Use the W3C validator to validate HTML documents</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And here is a view of my site concluding week 1:</p>

                        <h4>Adding publication dates</h4>
                        <p>The publication date uses the HTML5 element <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> . I checked the Mozilla documentation for the time element and the <code>datetime</code> attribute is a machine-readable format that improves search engine results.<sup><a href=“#w2-2”>2</a></sup></p>
                        <p>I added this new publication date to each article in their <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> elements and updated both the display text as well as the <code>datetime</code> attribute. I will look into adding a colour to these elements in the future to ensure they stand out.</p>
    
                        <h4>Unordered and ordered lists</h4>
                        <p>Next I used an unordered list <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> at the top of the first week post for the module sections and an ordered list <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> at the end of the first week post for I learned in our first week. Each list uses an encompassing tag with list items <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> within to represent each point or number.</p>
                        <p>I also used the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag to cover the code elements and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags for document names and other important information to emphasize their importance. These elements look a bit plain however I will add more styling to them later on.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>Navigation links using anchor tags</h4>
                        <p>Next I added a relative link using the same <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag by instead of linking to another local site page or an external site page, I added a link to an ID of an element on the same page.</p>
                        <p>I did this by making the anchor’s <em>href</em> link to an element’s ID. I added an anchor element at the top of the page and gave it the ID of <code>#top</code>. By clicking the link, the browser automatically scrolls to the element with the matching ID.</p>
                        <p>Since each ID can/should only be used on a single element, the page should never scroll to the wrong element.</p>
    
                        <h4>Adding images and copyright</h4>
                        <p>After, I had to add a copyright-free image to the weekly posts using the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>img</code> and <code>figcaption</code> tags.</p>
                        <p>The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag is an image wrapper that illustrates the web page content. Within this element is contained the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag which is the source file of the image. Also within the <code>figure</code> element is the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag which illustrates the source image attached.</p>
                        <p>To ensure the picture was copyright-free, I took a picture of the Huxley building from my iPhone 7 and used that.</p>
                        <p>I added at least a single image to all posts thus far to later be used for banner images. Intend for the website to look its best on all possible screen sizes including mobile and high resolution desktops.</p>
                        <blockquote>Note that I have temporarily added a style block in the header to make images sane for a while since their intended sizes cannot be dynamically be set yet due to no CSS file, no viewport or media queries.</blockquote>
    
                        <h4>Creating email anchor tags</h4>
                        <p>For the email link, I added another anchor tag to my footer with a <code>href</code> that includes the <code>mailto</code> flag to open the user’s default mail application and send me an email.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this week’s tutorial I validated my code on w3.org<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup> again to ensure I hadn’t made any silly mistakes and that I am conforming to the HTML5 standard. Sure enough it came back with no errors!</p>

                        <!-- BONUS SECTION -->
                        <h4>Further learning</h4>
                        <p>I was determined to save myself some time by adding automation for deployment and looked into if GitHub actions could, rather than use FTP to send the updated content, use Rsync to sync the files from the GitHub account over to the remote hosting server.</p>
    
                        <p>The server is hosted on a Linux Apache machine, I could use my credentials to SSH into the machine. Sure enough Rsync is available on the box and could upload files that way. I then looked into the GitHub Action to deploy the code and I found this one:<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup></p>
                        
                        <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                            <img src="images/rsync-deploy-action-github.jpg" alt="GitHub Actions rsync deploy screenshot" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                            <figcaption>GitHub Actions rsync deploy screenshot<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                            <small>Screenshot &copy; Author 2020</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                            </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                        </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->
    
                        <p>This looked promising. I unfortunately couldn’t create a <em>deploy</em> user to ensure if anything happened to my GitHub account, they wouldn’t gain full system access however I used secrets for all my credentials and upload destinations to ensure security.</p>
    
                        <p>Finally I had my code uploading without a hitch and I could say goodbye to FileZilla eating into my time having to constantly upload the new files.</p>
    
                        <p>To compare time to deploy between the FTP and RSYNC, FTP took 1 minute on average and didn't delete old removed files. RSYNC completes in 20 seconds even with large payloads and removes the unused files to match the structure in the repository. Definitely a big upgrade!</p>
    
                        <p>I also did some research into the <code>pre</code> tag<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup> as in future posts, I would very much like to add full blocks of code rather than inline. The <code>pre</code> tag enclosing the <code>code</code> tag like so</p>
    
<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    System.out.println();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>
    
                        <p>This way with some future formatting, I could still use the <code>code</code> semantics with a wrapper to ensure it was on its own line with the pre-formatted code maintained!</p>

                    <div class="article-main">
                        <p>This week our objectives were to <sup><a href="#w3-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make use of nested lists</li>
                            <li>Add a table</li>
                            <li>Quote text</li>
                            <li>Make an image with a link</li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <h4>Make use of nested lists</h4>
                        <p>We have previously used lists in week 2 however we can nest a list <em>within</em> a list to create a sub list. <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> only allow exactly zero or more <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements however we can use an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element and add a list to it.</p>
    
                        <p>By doing this, we can create more complex lists like the following showing each week <em>and</em> what we covered in each of those weeks thus far.</p>
    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Week 1
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Set up site folder</li>
                                    <li>Create index.html</li>
                                    <li>Create guide.html</li>
                                    <li>Link files in a lists for navigation</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Week 2
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Add a publication date to each post</li>
                                    <li>Add a list to a post</li>
                                    <li>Create in-page navigation links</li>
                                    <li>Add a copyright-free image</li>
                                    <li>Create an email link</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <p>We can also create a third type of list called a <em>description list</em>. Like the other lists, we use an encapsulating tag <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> (description list) and within we have description term <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>. We also have the term description <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> which is used to further expand on the term with a long description. This would be useful for something like a glossary of terms with the term as a <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and an <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> containing its description.</p>
    
                        <dl>

                        <h4>Adding a table</h4>
                        <p>Next we look at creating a new table. I remember the old days back in 2007 taking IT in secondary school and nothing aligning correctly. It was the wild west with people recommending tables for structuring a whole site and floating elements left to make them sit side by side. Thank goodness those days are long gone and HTML5 and CSS3 solved this with CSS grid!</p>
    
                        <p>Back to the point, we can create a table using the <code>table</code> tag and within it, add table rows <code>tr</code>, table headers <code>th</code> for the headers and table data <code>td</code> for the table cells.</p>
    
                        <p>Since tables don't have any styling, we need to add <code>border="1"</code> in order to add a border around each cell and the table as a whole. This I know has been deprecated in favour of using CSS to style it. After all , HTML should be the structure containing the content and the CSS only for the styling.</p>
    
                        <p>Below is an example of a table using my university timetable of lectures and lab sessions.</p>
    
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Day / Time</th>
                                    <th>Mon</th>
                                    <th>Tue</th>
                                    <th>Wed</th>
                                    <th>Thur</th>
                                    <th>Fri</th>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                            </table>
                        </div>
    
                        <p>To note on this table, I have removed the <code>border="1"</code> and added the border in my temporary style tag in the header to conform with the HTML5 standard shown in the validator. I do understand that using CSS in the HTML document is bad practices however we will be working with CSS in the next week's tutorial. I will move this code next week.</p>
    
                        <h4>Quoting text using &lt;blockquote&gt;</h4>
                        <p>As this is a journal/blog, we will undoubtedly be using references and quoting the source material is very useful. For this I can use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element to wrap a referenced quote and its source<sup><a href="#w3-2">2</a> <a href="#w3-3">3</a></sup>. An example of a cited reference with a back-link to the source I have included a quote to the <code>aside</code> element from the w3.org website</p>
    
                        <blockquote> <!-- A Quote -->
                            <p> <!-- Quote Paragraph -->
                                The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content of the parenting sectioning content, and which could be considered separate from that content.
                            <p>
                            <footer> <!-- Footer for cite reference -->
                                <cite> <!-- Cited Link Reference -->
                                    - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-aside-element" target="_blank">W3C standards for web design</a>
                                </cite>
                            </footer>
                        </blockquote> <!-- End Block Quote-->
    
    
                        <h4>Making an image link to a resource</h4>
                        <p>Moving onto more advanced anchor elements. We can wrap any element in anchor tags to make the child elements link to a given source much like our text does in a standard anchor element. Here we can make a new paragraph containing an anchor link that has an image as its clickable asset.</p>
    
                        <p>In this example I use the W3C HTML5 logo with CSS styling logo </p>
    
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/" target="_blank">
                                <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-h-css3.png" width="133" height="64" alt="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling" title="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling" />
                            </a><br />
                            The W3C has made an HTML5 logo that you can add to your web page. The HTML5 logo is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 — so it is free to use.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>To conclude the tutorial I run the validator to ensure there were no mistakes and I received the following error</p>
    
                        <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                            <img src="images/border-1-error.jpg" alt="Validator error of border=1 screenshot" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                            <figcaption>Validation error on table for border<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                            <small>Screenshot &copy; Author</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                            </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                        </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->
    
                        <p>I initially removed the <code>border=1</code> property but that removed the border and made reading the table far more difficult.</p>
    
                        <p>Since HTML5 moves all styling out of HTML and into CSS, I had to create table lines using my temporary css block at the top of the page. This allowed me to bring back the same styling using the following code</p>
    
<pre><code>table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>
    
                        <p>With this new change I ran the validator and received no errors or warnings. I have now added multiple styles to the head of my document and cant wait to create the CSS file, link it and start styling my site next week!</p>

                        <p>This week our objectives were to <sup><a href="#w4-1">1</a></sup>:</p>

                        <h4>Adding <code>normalize.css</code> from GitHub</h4>
                        <p>This week we are focusing on Cascading Style Sheets or <strong>CSS</strong> for short. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on different mediums such as screens, paper or even brail.</p>
                        <p>The first stylesheet I am adding is the <code>normalize.css</code> stylesheet from Necolas on GitHub. This stylesheet has a very useful function. It ensures that all the basic elements are displayed in a consistent manor, or 'normalize', as the name would suggest.</p>
                        <p>The external stylesheets are added in the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element at the top of the HTML document. This would look something like this:</p>
    
                        <pre><code>&lt;link href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;</code></pre>
    
                        <h4>Adding our own stylesheet</h4>
                        <p>Now the page is normalized, I can add my own new stylesheet for my own layout and colour schemes. For this I created another new file called <em>stylesheet.css</em> in the <em>css</em> folder. Here I used the template provided by the tutorial which contained some empty blocks where styling can be added.</p>
    
                        <h4>Style the body element</h4>
                        <p>The body element is the first viewable element of the page and represents the whole viewable content. By setting a background colour using <code>background-color: gray;</code> we can set the background colour to a nice grey.</p>
    
                        <h4>Style other elements</h4>
                        <h5>The headings <code>h1 - h6</code></h5>
                        <p>These header elements are used in a similar way to to a report. The first heading, heading 1, represents the top level with all following in a natural hierarchy. For this purpose we can resize all of these elements in descending order.</p>
    
                        <h5>The paragraph <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag</h5>
                        <p>The paragraph tag is initially influenced or <em>inherited</em> by the css rules set in the <code>body</code>. I decided to add the <em>Montserrat</em> font from Google as the primary font for all content on my web page. I initially set it for the <code>p</code> tags however founding it more fitting to simply add it in the <code>body</code> style since it will affect list items and other non <em>p</em> elements too.</p>
    
                        <h5>The wrapper &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;</h5>
                        <p>The wrapper element we are using to encompass all elements on the page, we can assign style to that container. As a start, having all the content in a max size box would make reading far easier and having that content centered would be more visually pleasing composition wise. To do this, I set the <code>max-width</code> value to 1000px and set the <code>margin</code> to auto. This way the wrapper will shrink down but only expand up to 1000px. And when there is a gap, add a margin to both sides equally.</p>
    
                        <p>I will later be removing this wrapper as this can easily be done using the <code>body</code> element and use css grid to organize content within. I will want some banner images to span the full screen width in the future too. By creating a max width and margin now, I will have trouble spanning an image across.</p>
    
                        <h5>The anchor &lt;a&gt; tag pseudo-classes</h5>
                        <p>The anchor elements have different states depending on what actions have been taken on the page. For example, when the anchor tag has a link, it goes from being the regular font colour to having a <em>link colour</em>.</p>
    
                        <p>On top of that, if you hover over the link, the style changes again to use yet another colour and add an underline to the text.</p>
    
                        <p>We can affect these states by referencing the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag's pseudo-elements. These are represented as <code>a</code> with a colon and the pseudo-element name. For example, the one for <em>hover</em> would look like this:</p>
    
<pre><code>a:hover {
    color: red;    
}</code></pre>
    
                        <p>In this example, we have every anchor element which is hovered, change its colour to red.</p>
    
                        <p>There is an order to these pseudo-elements and must be updated in a certain order. This being: <code>a</code>, <code>a:link</code>, <code>a:visited</code>, <code>a:hover</code></p>
    
                        <p>We can also influence only certain tags within other elements to make, for instance, only links within the articles red instead of blue which is applied everywhere else. To do this, I added the following:</p>
    
<pre><code>article a:link {
    color: red;
}</code></pre>
    
                        <p>By adding the parent element and then the element we want to affect, we can specify exactly where we want these css rules to apply.</p>
    
                        <h5>The main menu &lt;nav&gt;</h5>
                        <p>Navigation menus are usually implemented using list items as they contain natural hierarchy with nesting. The issue is that the elements aren't placed side-by-side left to right and they have bullet points next to each element.</p>
    
                        <p>We can remove these by setting the <code>list-style-type</code> to none and make the <code>nav</code>'s anchor elements have a different link style.</p>
    
                        <h5>The article headers &lt;header class="post"&gt;</h5>
                        <p>I could apply styles directly to the <code>header</code> however this would affect both the article header and the page header at the same time. Instead I applied the styling to the <code>post</code> class which I can specify on all the article headers.</p>
    
                        <p>A more efficient method for doing this would be to simply state 'only apply to headers which are children of the article element' like this:</p>
    
<pre><code>article header {
    background-color: grey;
}</code></pre>
    
                        <p>This would prevent the requirement of each header needing the class set and adding another article would be trivial.</p>
    
                        <p>As always, the last part of testing is to check the HTML and CSS is HTML5 compliant. Neither of these documents resulted in any errors and is ready to be uploaded!</p>

                    <div class="article-main">
                        <p>This week our objectives were to <sup><a href="#w5-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make a start on the tutorial.html document</li>
                            <li>Update all previous weeks with what we've learned so far</li>
                            <li>Add the viewport meta tag in the head of the pages</li>
                            <li>Use CSS to style fonts, line heights and float content</li>
                            <li>Validate the HTML and CSS</li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <h4>Starting the tutorial page</h4>
                        <p>Since this page is at the same stage as the first week, I updated all the layout and meta tags to match the main index document.</p>
    
                        <p>Next I added an introduction and pomodoro section to this guide explaining with case studies how better study time management can improve results and have personally applied this technique to my own studies which has helped me focus for extended periods of time.</p>
    
                        <h4>Weekly Learning</h4>
                        <p>As for previous weeks' learning, I have been keeping this up to date as I go along to ensure I cover all of what I've done and while it's fresh in my memory.</p>
    
                        <h4>Viewport Meta Tag</h4>
                        <p>The viewport meta tag in the head of the document is used to help control the width and scaling of the viewport so that the content is sized correctly on all devices.</p>
    
                        <h4>External Fonts</h4>
                        <p>I have already started using google fonts from last week and have now added 2 more fonts; one for the main <code>h1</code> headings and the other for code blocks to use a monospace font.</p>
    
                        <h4>Floating Images</h4>
                        <p>Block elements are usually placed one below the other. In some cases we may want content to wrap or be beside other content such as text around an image. For this we need to use the <code>float</code> style on an element.</p>
    
                        <p>Below I'll show an example of this floating action and the code that goes with it:</p>
    
                        <div id="float-example">
                            <img src="images/jb_thumbnail.png" alt="JB Thumbnail Image" />
                            <p>Here we can see the text wrapping around the thumbnail image!</p>
                        </div>
    
                        <p>Here we set the image within the float-example div to be <code>float: left;</code> which will allow content to flow around the image with the image on the left.</p>
    
                        <h4>Line Height, Text Indenting and Alignment</h4>
                        <p>These are very useful styles which we have control over. Line height affects the distance between lines of the same paragraph and can improve readability for those who are hard of seeing or suffer like I do from learning disabilities such as dyslexia.</p>
    
                        <p>Text indentation alters the indent at the beginning of a paragraph and can shift the text along without the need to add random spaces to the start of the text (which would be very bad practice).</p>
    
                        <p>Text Alignment allows the control of how the text is formatted to the page. By default the text is left aligned however we can change this to be right aligned, centered or even justified.</p>
    
                        <h4>Validation</h4>
                        <p>I made these changes and also validated my HTML + CSS for now both index and tutorial pages with no errors reported.</p>
    
                        <p>Here is a view of my site concluding week 5:</p>

                    <div class="article-main">
                        <p>This week our objectives were to <sup><a href="#w6-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Adjust our HTML and CSS</li>
                            <li>Setup a responsive layout</li>
                            <li>Implement a mobile first approach</li>
                            <li>Add media queries for different screen widths</li>
                            <li>Hide elements as required</li>
                            <li>Test the responsive design</li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <h4>Adjusting HTML and CSS</h4>
                        <p>I updated the layout of articles to use the banner in its own container. This is preparation for media queries to adjust the design.</p>
    
                        <h4>Setup Responsive Layouts</h4>
                        <p>I have updated the images to fill their containers using <code>width: 100%;</code>. With this and a <code>max-width: 800px;</code> for the article containers, I can now make images a useful size on mobiles and desktops.</p>
    
                        <h4>Implementing a Mobile-First Approach</h4>
                        <p>I have started this design primarily for the standard mobile size most used in the market. With more devices accessing the internet from small size devices like mobiles and other handheld touch devices, I have my design, before the use of media queries, to be for mobiles first.</p>
    
                        <h4>Using Media Queries</h4>
                        <p>By using <code>@media</code> queries, I can set different CSS rules to be applied based on the screen size. I have setup a couple of initial checks for devices smaller than the original design to cater for tiny screens like iPod touch generations and other old iPhones which have a 4.7" screen.</p>
    
                        <p>Next I have added more rules for devices larger than a standard mobile aimed at tablet devices which are still used with touch input.</p>
    
                        <p>Finally I have a general rule for screens that are the standard screen size for small laptops 1024px up to any size as the text will scale.</p>
    
                        <h4>Hiding Elements</h4>
                        <p>For the smallest screen sizes, I have chosen to hide all the image content as the main content does not require the images within <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></p>
    
                        <h4>Testing the Design</h4>
                        <p>For testing, I have fired up my old iPod Touch, iPhone 7 and my recent phone iPhone 11 to give a good range of mobile screen sizes. I also checked on my mobile app development Huawei P20 to ensure android devices don't have any weird issues. I also checked across different mobile browsers. All showed the same result thanks to the normalize.css code and my stylesheet.css layout.</p>
    
                        <h4>Validation</h4>
                        <p>I made these changes and run the validator against both HTML and CSS file. No errors so on to the next week!</p>
    
                        <p>Here is a view of my site concluding week 6:</p>

                    <div class="article-main">
                        <p>This week our objectives were to <sup><a href="#7-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make the media (images and video) on the page flexible</li>
                            <li>Optimise images for better loading times</li>
                            <li>Refactor code accordingly</li>
                            <li>Run validation</li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <h4>Making Media Flexible</h4>
                        <p>For the most part, I have set my images that are within the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tags to be set to <code>width: 100%;</code> on the main layout for mobile. This way all images will be as clear as possible without much scrolling required.</p>

                        <p>I have also set the banner images to be background elements when moving to a desktop size screen. This has been achieved using <em>CSS Grid</em> with the scroll element set to <em>sticky</em> to lock it in place.</p>

                        <p>Having all these images on the page is now affecting the loading speed of the page. I have been using an extension made by Google to rank the page on design for accessibility, speed and performance. This extension is called Lighthouse and was primarily developed to aide in the effort of creating mobile first websites along with Progressive Web Apps (PWA).<sup><a href="#7-2">2</a></sup> </p>
    
                        <p>A PWA website is able to be installed on a device and run locally without requiring internet. This is very powerful for developers to make a website that can double as an application that users can bookmark or even install to their mobile devices and use like a native application.</p>

                        <p>I have attached the score given to my site so far and will show the improved performance after having refactored the code and optimized the images in the next sections.</p>

                        <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                            <img src="images/lighthouse-score-pre-week7.jpg" alt="Lighthouse score for my week 7 website" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                            <figcaption>Lighthouse score for my week 7 website<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                            <small>Screenshot &copy; Author</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                            </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                        </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->

                        <h4>Optimizing Images</h4>
                        <p>The main cause for such a poor performance score is due to the images and more to the point, their file sizes. There are many ways to reduce an image's file size. The route I took is to run them through a compressor service such as compressor.io. This website will accept images up to 10 megabytes in size and compress the images to shrink the file size. I have applied this to all of the images used on the site bar one which is the logo used in the hero section. I want this logo to be in the highest quality possible to be eye catching.</p>

                        <p>From simply reducing these file sizes using a compressor, the results speak for themselves:</p>

                        <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                            <img src="images/lighthouse-score-mid-week7.jpg" alt="Lighthouse score after compressing images for my week 7 website" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                            <figcaption>Lighthouse score after compressing images<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                            <small>Screenshot &copy; Author</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                            </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                        </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->
    
                        <h4>Further Optimization</h4>
                        <p>The fun for optimization doesn't stop there. We can also reduce the dimensions of the image as the full resolution of the images are not always going to be seen. For this, we can put our images through an image editor and reduce the resolution to be the maximum width that it will ever be displayed in.</p>

                        <p>For my site, I'm using a column design that alternates between left and right. This benefits me in that I never need a full screen sized image as these panels lock out at 960px each. I do have to be careful as the mobile-first design can also stretch to 1200px before the styles switch.</p>

                        <p>The final result of reducing all the images to this max displayable size has further affected the loading score!</p>

                        <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                            <img src="images/lighthouse-score-end-week7.jpg" alt="Lighthouse score after reducing the resolution of images for my week 7 website" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                            <figcaption>Lighthouse score after compressing and re-scaling images<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                            <small>Screenshot &copy; Author</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                            </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                        </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->

                        <p>On a final note, there is a last optimization to the css style for each of the banner images. Here I set the mobile first design to use a half-sized image when on mobile to save bandwidth and for desktops to use the full fat image as these will most likely be on wired internet rather than mobile data. Just a small nudge to help mobile users.</p>

                        <h4>Refactoring Code</h4>
                        <p>Making my banner image appear as a background required a new <code>div</code> element with the banner images set as a <code>background-image</code> so it would fall behind the content and not be clickable. I have also taken this chance to restructure and comment all my css stylesheet code into discrete sections that can easily be followed and rules found. I use a <code>:root</code> block for core colours that can be referenced throughout the sheet as primary colours, page colours, hover transitions times and so on. This way if I wish to change the primary colour, I only need to update the root value and the change will be referenced everywhere.</p>
    
                        <h4>Validation</h4>
                        <p>With the refactoring of code, I wanted to make sure there were no errors or validation errors introduced. Thankfully since all the code was simply moved and small changes updated, there were no errors in either the HTML or CSS code.</p>
