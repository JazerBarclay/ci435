                <p>For my first week of CI435, I was tasked with: reading our course specification on MyStudies and setting up my brighton.domains account where I will be making my first three HTML pages.<sup><a href="#w1-1">1</a></sup></p>

                <h4>Setting up brighton domains</h4>
                <p>The lab session started with logging into the computers and accessing the MyStudies page. Here I could go to CI435 to view all the information about the web development module.</p>
                <p>In the module area there are the following sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Module Information which shows the module specification, the teaching plan and link to teaching staff contact details</li>
                    <li>Reading List -  A list of books we can access virtually to learn more about HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>Assessments and Marks - A grading criteria and module guideline</li>
                    <li>Study Materials -  Where all the content from the lectures is accessible and other learning resources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the study section, there’s a folder called '<em>SEMESTER 1 study material</em>' where the slides for the previous lectures are available.</p>
                <p>Under week 1 there is a link to the lecture and another for the lab tutorial site <em>jh1033.bright.domains</em> with instructions for building the website.</p>
                <p>Starting at the induction and going through setting up brighton.domains. I went to the dashboard tab at the top and logged into my account.</p>
                <p>Here I can access the file manager to see the files hosted on the server.</p>
                <p>We were instructed to create a new folder named ‘<em>ci435</em>’ under the public_html folder which is the root folder of the hosted website.</p>
                <p>Since this is an apache server hosted on a linux system, the folders when we later access them on the live URL, are case sensitive so keeping to lower case makes navigation simple as long as we keep to that design pattern. Note also that the web page names must also follow this convention.</p>
                <p>In this new folder we can create a new file named ‘<em>index.html</em>’. This is the default file the server will use when the folder is accessed. Here is where our learning journal site will begin.</p>

                <h4>Starting the 3 pages</h4>
                <p>There was a template provided in the lab tutorial which we were instructed to copy into the contents of the index.html document and save.</p>
                <p>With the contents saved, if I navigated to the url <em>jb2139.brighton.domains/ci435</em>, I could see the copied template live from any device.</p>
                <p>Next I created the second and third pages for the tutorial and contact pages respectively using the same template from the first (index) page.</p>
                <p>These were based from the same template however must link back to all there other pages on the site.</p>
                <p>Though these were based on the same template, they must link back to all the other pages on the site.</p>
                <p>I used the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag to create links between the different pages and ensured they all worked on every page.</p>
                <p>I found that the live version of the site sometimes didn’t update and as a result I found that Chrome has ‘<em>hard refresh</em>’ functionality where holding Shift and clicking the refresh button would force the page to be called rather than using a cached version which was no longer up to date.</p>
                <p>With how the domain hosting is setup, I would create a new subdomain for each project so rather than a subdirectory called <em>ci435</em>, I would make a subdomain ci435.jb2139.brighton.domains. This separation would make for future package management easier should I use wordpress or another content management system.</p>

                <h4>W3C validation</h4>
                <p>As a final step to our first week lab session, we needed to test that our code conformed to the W3C standards for HTML5.</p>
                <p>My website index.html, tutorial.html and contact.html all gave no errors and no warnings.</p>
                <p>I checked the next week’s lab page and we will be covering HTML markup such as time, lists, anchors, images and email links.<sup><a href="#w1-2">2</a></sup></p>

                <!-- BONUS SECTION -->
                <h4>Further learning</h4>
                <p>I notices when writing up this section that there references are in an aside element only in the wrapper rather than per section. I did some searching for if the HTML5 standard recommends only a single aside element however using one per article is accepted as good practice. The aside element is used to identify content that is related to the primary content of the webpage, but does not constitute the primary content of the page.<sup><a href="#w1-3">3</a></sup></p>
                <p>Since testing the web pages, I have added my code to Github where all changes are stored and kept backed up. By hosting my code here, I can keep track of all the weekly changes and revert my code should I break something and want to go back to the last working version.<sup><a href="#w1-4">4</a></sup></p>
                <p>Downloaded the code from GitHub to my personal laptop where I could make local changes without constantly updating the web page. I’ve found this useful when working off-line when commuting and also prefer the interface of Visual Studio Code which is the editor I use for programming.<sup><a href="#w1-5">5</a></sup></p>
                <p>Furthermore I have started to use FileZilla to upload my code since the GitHub action cannot upload automatically due to how the SFTP server is configured.<sup><a href="#w1-6">6</a></sup></p>
                
                <p>In summary, this week I learned how to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set up a folder for my website on my Brighton Domains workspace</li>
                    <li>Link two pages together with a navigation menu using a relative link</li>
                    <li>Create links to external websites using an absolute link</li>
                    <li>When to use the <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> tags</li>
                    <li>Update the web page title</li>
                    <li>Use the W3C validator to validate HTML documents</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And here is a view of my site concluding week 1:</p>

                <!-- Main element of article -->
                <p>This week our objective was to <sup><a href="#w2-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add a publication date to each post</li>
                    <li>Add a list to a post</li>
                    <li>Create in-page navigation links</li>
                    <li>Add a copyright-free image</li>
                    <li>Create an email link</li>
                </ol>

                <!-- Week 2 Banner -->
                <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                    <img src="images/huxley-building.jpeg" alt="A picture of the Huxley building" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                    <figcaption>The Huxley building on Moulscoomb campus<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->

                </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->

                <h4>Adding publication dates</h4>
                <p>The publication date uses the HTML5 element <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> . I checked the Mozilla documentation for the time element and the <code>datetime</code> attribute is a machine-readable format that improves search engine results.<sup><a href=“#w2-2”>2</a></sup></p>
                <p>I added this new publication date to each article in their <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> elements and updated both the display text as well as the <code>datetime</code> attribute. I will look into adding a colour to these elements in the future to ensure they stand out.</p>

                <h4>Unordered and ordered lists</h4>
                <p>Next I used an unordered list <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> at the top of the first week post for the module sections and an ordered list <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> at the end of the first week post for I learned in our first week. Each list uses an encompassing tag with list items <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> within to represent each point or number.</p>
                <p>I also used the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag to cover the code elements and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags for document names and other important information to emphasise their importance. These elements look a bit plain however I will add more styling to them later on.
                </p>

                <h4>Navigation links using anchor tags</h4>
                <p>Next I added a relative link using the same <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag by instead of linking to another local site page or an external site page, I added a link to an ID of an element on the same page.</p>
                <p>I did this by making the anchor’s <em>href</em> link to an element’s ID. I added an anchor element at the top of the page and gave it the ID of <code>#top</code>. By clicking the link, the browser automatically scrolls to the element with the matching ID.</p>
                <p>Since each ID can/should only be used on a single element, the page should never scroll to the wrong element.</p>

                <h4>Adding images and copyright</h4>
                <p>After, I had to add a copyright-free image to the weekly posts using the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>img</code> and <code>figcaption</code> tags.</p>
                <p>The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag is an image wrapper that illustrates the web page content. Within this element is contained the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag which is the source file of the image. Also within the <code>figure</code> element is the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag which illustrates the source image attached.</p>
                <p>To ensure the picture was copyright-free, I took a picture of the Huxley building from my iPhone 7 and used that.</p>
                <p>I added at least a single image to all posts thus far to later be used for banner images. Intend for the website to look its best on all possible screen sizes including mobile and high resolution desktops.</p>
                <blockquote>Note that I have temporarily added a style block in the header to make images sane for a while since their intended sizes cannot be dynamically be set yet due to no CSS file, no viewport or media queries.</blockquote>

                <h4>Creating email anchor tags</h4>
                <p>For the email link, I added another anchor tag to my footer with a <code>href</code> that includes the <code>mailto</code> flag to open the user’s default mail application and send me an email.</p>
                <p>To conclude this week’s tutorial I validated my code on w3.org<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup> again to ensure I hadn’t made any silly mistakes and that I am conforming to the HTML5 standard. Sure enough it came back with no errors!</p>

                <!-- BONUS SECTION -->
                <h4>Further learning</h4>
                <p>I was determined to save myself some time by adding automation for deployment and looked into if GitHub actions could, rather than use FTP to send the updated content, use RSYNC to sync the files from the GitHub account over to the remote hosting server.</p>

                <p>The server is hosted on a Linux Apache machine, I could use my credentials to SSH into the machine. Sure enough rsync is available on the box and could upload files that way. I then looked into the GitHub Action to deploy the code and I found this one:<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup></p>
                
                <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                    <img src="images/rsync-deploy-action-github.png" alt="GitHub Actions rsync deploy screenshot" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                    <figcaption>GitHub Actions rsync deploy screenshot<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                    <small>Screenshot &copy; Jazer Barclay 2020</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                    </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->

                <p>This looked promising. I unfortunately couldn’t create a <em>deploy</em> user to ensure if anything happened to my GitHub account, they wouldn’t gain full system access however I used secrets for all my credentials and upload destinations to ensure security.</p>

                <p>Finally I had my code uploading without a hitch and I could say goodbye to FileZilla eating into my time having to constantly upload the new files.</p>

                <p>To compare time to deploy between the FTP and RSYNC, FTP took 1 minute on average and didn't delete old removed files. RSYNC completes in 20 seconds even with large payloads and removes the unused files to match the structure in the repository. Definately a big upgrade!</p>

                <p>I also did some research into the <code>pre</code> tag<sup><a href="#w2-3">3</a></sup> as in future posts, I would very much like to add full blocks of code rather than inline. The <code>pre</code> tag enclosing the <code>code</code> tag like so</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    System.out.println();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

                <p>This way with some future formatting, I could still use the <code>code</code> semantics with a wrapper to ensure it was on its own line with the pre-formatted code maintained!</p>

                <p>Here is a view of my site concluding week 2:</p>

                <h4>Make use of nested lists</h4>
                <p>We have previously used lists in week 2 however we can nest a list <em>within</em> a list to create a sub list. <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> only allow exactly zero or more <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements however we can use an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element and add a list to it.</p>

                <p>By doing this, we can create more complex lists like the following showing each week <em>and</em> what we covered in each of those weeks thus far.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Week 1
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set up site folder</li>
                            <li>Create index.html</li>
                            <li>Create guide.html</li>
                            <li>Link files in a lists for navigation</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Week 2
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add a publication date to each post</li>
                            <li>Add a list to a post</li>
                            <li>Create in-page navigation links</li>
                            <li>Add a copyright-free image</li>
                            <li>Create an email link</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>We can also create a third type of list called a <em>description list</em>. Like the other lists, we use an encapsulating tag <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> (description list) and within we have description term <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>. We also have the term description <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> which is used to further expand on the term with a long description. This would be useful for something like a glossary of terms with the term as a <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and an <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> containing its description.</p>

                </dl>


                <h4>Adding a table</h4>
                <p>Next we look at creating a new table. I remember the old days back in 2007 taking IT in secondary school and nothing aligning correctly. It was the wild west with people recommending tables for structuring a whole site and floating elements left to make them sit side by side. Thank goodness those days are long gone and HTML5 and CSS3 solved this with CSS grid!</p>

                <p>Back to the point, we can create a table using the <code>table</code> tag and within it, add table rows <code>tr</code>, table headers <code>th</code> for the headers and table data <code>td</code> for the table cells.</p>

                <p>Since tables don't have any styling, we need to add <code>border="1"</code> in order to add a border around each cell and the table as a whole. This I know has been deprecated in favour of using CSS to style it. After all , HTML should be the structure containing the content and the CSS only for the styling.</p>

                <p>Below is an example of a table using my university timetable of lectures and lab sessions.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Day/time</th>
                        <th>Monday</th>
                        <th>Tuesday</th>
                        <th>Wednesday</th>
                        <th>Thursday</th>
                        <th>Friday</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>9am-10am</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI404 Lecture</td>
                        <td>CI435 Lab</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10am-11am</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI404 Lecture</td>
                        <td>CI453 Lab</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>11am-12pm</td>

                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>12pm-1pm</td>
                        <td>CI401 Seminar</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1pm-2pm</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI453 Lecture</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2pm-3pm</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI401 Lecture</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI404 Lab</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>3pm-4pm</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI401 Lab</td>
                        <td>CI404 Lab</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>4pm-5pm</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI405 Lecture</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI405 Lab</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5pm-6pm</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>CI435 Lecture</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>To note on this table, I have removed the <code>border="1"</code> and added the border in my temporary style tag in the header to conform with the HTML5 standard shown in the validator. I do understand that using CSS in the HTML document is bad practices however we will be working with CSS in the next week's tutorial. I will move this code next week.</p>

                <h4>Quoting text using &lt;blockquote&gt;</h4>
                <p>As this is a journal/blog, we will undoubtably be using references and quoting the source material is very useful. For this I can use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element to wrap a referenced quote and its source<sup><a href="#w3-2">2</a> <a href="#w3-3">3</a></sup>. An example of a cited reference with a backlink to the source I have included a quote to the <code>aside</code> element from the w3.org website</p>

                <blockquote> <!-- A Quote -->
                    <p> <!-- Quote Paragraph -->
                        The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content of the parenting sectioning content, and which could be considered separate from that content.
                    <p>
                    <footer> <!-- Footer for cite reference -->
                        <cite> <!-- Cited Link Reference -->
                            - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-aside-element">W3C standards for web design</a>
                        </cite>
                    </footer>
                </blockquote> <!-- End Block Quote-->


                <h4>Making an image link to a resource</h4>
                <p>Moving onto more advanced anchor elements. We can wrap any element in anchor tags to make the child elements link to a given source much like our text does in a standard anchor element. Here we can make a new paragraph containing an anchor link that has an image as its clickable asset.</p>

                <p>In this example I use the W3C HTML5 logo with CSS styling logo </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">
                        <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-v-css3.png" alt="HTML5 logo" />
                    </a>
                    The W3C has made an HTML5 logo that you can add to your web page. The HTML5 logo is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 — so it is free to use.
                </p>

                <p>To conclude the tutorial I run the validator to ensure there were no mistakes and I received the following error</p>

                <figure> <!-- Image that illustrates the web page content -->
                    <img src="images/border-1-error.png" alt="Validator error of border=1 screenshot" /> <!-- Source file of the image -->
                    <figcaption>Validation error on table for border<br /> <!-- Illustration caption -->
                    <small>Screenshot &copy; Jazer Barclay</small> <!-- Copyright Image -->
                    </figcaption> <!-- End Caption-->
                </figure> <!-- End figure markup -->

                <p>I initially removed the <code>border=1</code> property but that removed the border and made reading the table far more difficult.</p>

                <p>Since HTML5 moves all styling out of HTML and into CSS, I had to create table lines using my temporary css block at the top of the page. This allowed me to bring back the same styling using the following code</p>

<pre><code>table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>

                <p>With this new change I ran the validator and received no errors or warnings. I have now added multiple styles to the head of my document and cant wait to create the CSS file, link it and start styling my site next week!</p>

                <p>Here is a view of my site concluding week 3:</p>

                <p>This week we are focusing on Cascading Style Sheets or <strong>CSS</strong> for short. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on different mediums such as screens, paper or even brail.</p>
                <p>The first stylesheet I am adding is the <code>normalise.css</code> stylesheet from necolas on GitHub. This stylesheet has a very useful function. It ensures that all the basic elements are displayed in a consistent manor, or 'normalise', as the name would suggest.</p>
                <p>The external stylesheets are added in the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element at the top of the HTML document. This would look something like this:</p>

                <pre><code>&ltlink href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;</code></pre>

                <h4>Adding our own stylesheet</h4>
                <p>Now the page is normalised, I can add my own new stylesheet for my own layout and colour schemes. For this I created another new file called <em>stylesheet.css</em> in the <em>css</em> folder. Here I used the template provided by the tutorial which contained some empty blocks where styling can be added.</p>

                <h4>Style the body element</h4>
                <p>The body element is the first viewable element of the page and represents the whole viewable content. By setting a background colour using <code>background-color: gray;</code> we can set the background colour to a nice grey.</p>

                <h4>Style other elements</h4>
                <h5>The headings <code>h1 - h6</code></h5>
                <p>These header elements are used in a similar way to to a report. The first heading, heading 1, represents the top level with all following in a natural heirarchy. For this purpose we can resize all of these elements in descending order.</p>

                <h5>The paragraph &lt;p&gt; tag</h5>
                <p></p>

                <h5>The wrapper &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;</h5>
                <p></p>

                <h5>The anchor &lt;a&gt; tag psudo-classes</h5>
                <p></p>

                <h5>The main menu &lt;nav&gt;</h5>
                <p></p>

                <h5>The article headers &lt;header class="post"&gt;</h5>
                <p></p>
