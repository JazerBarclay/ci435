# CI435 - Introduction to Web Development
This is my learning journal for my first year web development course at the University of Brighton.

I have created releases for each weeks worth of work so you can download all the different stages of my work without having to know anything about Git or Github!

All code here is written by me and all references are added on the index page for each section they are used in.

Hope this helps other students who are learning HTML / CSS for the first time
